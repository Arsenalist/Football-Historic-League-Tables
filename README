This is a CodeIgniter application located at http://stats.arsenalist.com.

The app displays past football league tables based on a date.  It can also
visualize the league's title races in a chart.  This happens by utilizing the
Google Charts API (I really do need to cache those calls, and not generate them every time).

The data is read from http://www.football-data.co.uk using a cron process, which is
located in the 'cron' directory.
